# iOS Development Environment
Development and research tools for jailbroken iOS.  

## Repositories
In this Repository you can see an actively maintained list of APT (Cydia) repositories.  
The purpose of this list is to give researchers, administrators, ethical hackers and developers easy access to existing tools.  
Anyone following the requirements that it should be a dev / admin / security / research tool can contribute to this repository with a pull request.  
The repositories must be tested and working on the latest version of iOS.  

## Development
In this folder you can find many utilities and sources with development tools for a jailbroken iOS distribution.  
Anyone writing code and scripts can find its hail there.  
If you want to contribute to the list you will need to make sure that the tools you want to add work on the latest iOS version.  
If not, you must either explain how to fix or compile it, or leave it as is and not add the tool.
